bernard black is the owner of black books, a small bookshop. the series revolves around the lives of bernard, manny and fran. a central theme is bernard's persona of a grouchy and misanthropic shopkeeper who has a hatred of the outside world and all the people who inhabit it, except for his best friend, fran, who initially ran a trendy bric-a-brac shop, nifty gifty, next-door to the shop. bernard displays little interest or knowledge in retail (or, indeed, anything outside drinking, smoking and reading) and actively avoids having to interact with anyone, even inside his shop, as he has a seething dislike towards his customers, treating his bookshop more like a personal library. it is suggested that fran and bernard once slept together, but now they remain content to be friends, sharing a love of smoking heavily and drinking to excess. fran otherwise is a hopeless romantic. manny is introduced in the first episode as an angst-ridden accountant who enters the bookshop seeking the little book of calm. during a drunken night out, bernard offers him a job as a shop assistant and a room above the shop if he will do bernard's accounts for him. sobering up, bernard realises manny's optimistic nature is not suited to this "kind of operation". fran, however, seeing that manny is good for bernard, forces bernard to let him stay. many episodes are driven by manny and fran's attempts to force bernard into a more socially acceptable lifestyle. their efforts usually result in chaos, sucking them back into bernard's cynical view of the world. the bookshop, which also doubles as manny and bernard's residence, is frequently depicted as being in an unlivable state of dirtiness and often inhabited by animals and other unidentified creatures, while disorder is a frequent aspect of the running of the shop. manny's attempts to improve both the shop and the residence often fail.
